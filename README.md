# Pomodoro Timer   

Personally I love using a pomodoro timer when I study. I'll usually do 2-3hrs of deep work, then i'll take a break and fire up my pomodoro timer to complete the remaining tasks. It helps a lot when your brain is already tired as it breaks down
your work into 4 short sessions. **Work 🠮 Short break (1) 🠮 Work 🠮 Short break (2) 🠮 Work 🠮 Short break (3) 🠮 Work 🠮 Long break (4)**. At the end of each block you get a longer break to let you're brain reset and get ready for the next block of work. Since this is a system I enjoy using and has helped me a lot, I decided to make my own **Pomodoro Timer** using the Tkinter module. 
This project was great practice for working with GUI's, and working with external python modules. While it's not anything groundbreaking or impressive, I enjoyed making something that i can now use and improve over time.

## How it works

Long breaks are initialized after you have completed 4 work reps. 

**Work** - 25 mins

# Installation  

1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate to the cloned repo directory on your machine
3. Run **python main.py** or **python3 main.py**

# Notes

I decided not to use OOP as I thought it would be a little too much for a small project like this. Practicing OOP structure was NOT the goal of this project, working with GUI and the Tkinter module was.
